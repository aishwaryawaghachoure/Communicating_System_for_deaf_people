# Communicating_System_for_deaf_people

The deaf community finds it difficult interacting with the listening community .This project is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf world and the listening world.For this purpose a leap motion controller is used . The four objectives of this project are:

●	Converting speech to text

●	Converting text to sign language

●	Converting Sign language to text

●	Converting text to Sign language

     
In spite of many advantages provided by this project which uses a palm sized leap motion sensor and provides a much more movable and moderate solution ,this classifier can further be improved with respect to speed and accuracy.
